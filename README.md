# A1-Perceptron-Training-NNCI-
Assignment 1  for the course Neural Networks and computational intelligence from the University of Groningen 

#Perceptron Training
The main assignment is to program the Rosenblatt perceptron algorithm, applied it to randomized
data, and compare the results with the theoretical findings (capacity of a hyperplane) in
computer experiments.
